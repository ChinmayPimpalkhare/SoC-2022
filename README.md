# SoC-2022

This is the repository that I intend to use to track my progress for the SoC 2022. The project that I am working on is the Child Face Generator and my mentors are Kaivaly Daga and Manav Doshi. 

## Mentee Checkpoint 1 (26 May 2022) 

What all have I completed uptil now? 
 - Since I use Windows and was not very well-acquainted with using Linux commands, I first of all went and learned how to use the command prompt properly. I also installed Ubuntu on VirtualBox but I do not know how useful that will be. 
 - I made myself familiar with using Git and for that watched a couple of videos sent by the mentors in addition to completing Git Immersion. I got my queries clarified. I also revised using Github and read an article on how one should write good commit messages. 
 - I was familiar with the basics of Python so I skipped that part and went over directly to getting to know tips and tricks in Python. In addition to that I read an article on good coding practices. 
 - I had already done a Udemy course on Machine Learning so I completely skipped the basic concepts. 
 - I also started with the basics of Deep Learning. Since I had done bits and pieces of this earlier, I have left most parts of it for later. I then started with the lectures on CNNs by Andrew Ng and covered half of the course content.
 
In general, the experience has been going on quite well, and I hope to pick up speed now. I wish to work more on the actual implementation aspects now since I really want to strengthen my coding as well as problem-solving skills.
